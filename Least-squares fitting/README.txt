#  Program for polynomial least-squares fitting

Here is a simple automated program which help to implement the Least square fitting method to obtain a polynomial regression

DETAILS:-

Input required form user:-

The program read data points from a text file
The user have an option of selecting the degree of polynomial for doing the polynomial regression. 


Output generated:-

The output from the program contains
(a) text file containing the coefficients of polynomials and coefficient of determination;
(b) figure showing the data points and the fitted polynomial. 


[Please download the whole folder and keep the input and output file in the same folder and run the python program]
[I have attached a sample test file with an output file which also gets generated when the program is run]
