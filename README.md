# Finding-roots-of-non-linear-equation-using-NewtonRaphson-and-Secant-Method

Here is a simple automated program which help to implement the the Newton Raphson method and Secant method for finding the roots of any non linear equation

DETAILS:-

Input required form user:-\n
A user interface for providing â€“ 
(i) Non-linear equation, 
(ii) Option to choose one of the two methods mentioned above, 
(iii) Starting values, and 
(iv) Stopping criteria in form of maximum iterations and maximum relative approximate error (in %). 

Output generated:-
(i) A table with all the results for each iterations
(ii) A plot between the function and the value of x for each iteration
