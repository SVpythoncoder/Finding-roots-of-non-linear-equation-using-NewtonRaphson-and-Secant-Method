#Solving a system of linear equations Ax=b

Here is an automated program which help to implement the various method of GAUSS ELIMINATION and LU decompsotion to solve a system of linear equation

DETAILS:

Input required from user:-

The program read the following inputs from a text file – 
(i) the number of equations(n), 
(ii) elements of the augmented matrix. 


The user have the option of selecting one of the following methods–
a. Gauss elimination (GE; without pivoting)
b. GE (with pivoting)
c. GE (with scaling and pivoting)
d. LU decomposition by using GE (without pivoting)
e. LU decomposition by using GE (with pivoting)
f. LU decomposition by using Crout method (without pivoting) 


Output generated:- 

The output from the program should be written in a text file. This file contain the
following results for different methods–
a. GE: the unknowns x, the permutation matrix (if pivoting is done), and the elements of U(upper triangular) Matrix
b. LU by GE: the unknowns x, the permutation matrix (if pivoting is done), and the elements of L and U
c. LU by Crout method: the unknowns x and the elements of L and U 


[Please download the whole folder and keep the input and output file in the same folder and run the python program]
[I have attached a sample test file with an output file which also gets generated when the program is run]
